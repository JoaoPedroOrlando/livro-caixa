  <h1>ðŸ“„ Privacy Policy â€“ Livro Caixa</h1>

  <p><strong>Last updated: June 28, 2025</strong></p>

  <p>Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how the <strong>Livro Caixa</strong> app collects, uses, stores, and shares your information.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>The <strong>Livro Caixa</strong> app collects and stores locally on your device the data you manually input, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Income and expense entries</li>
    <li>Added categories and descriptions</li>
    <li>Dates and times of records</li>
    <li>Exported files (CSV) â€“ if used</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>We do not collect personally identifiable information such as name, email, or location.</strong></p>

  <h2>2. Where Data is Stored</h2>
  <p>All data is <strong>stored locally on your device</strong> using the `expo-sqlite` database. The app <strong>does not transmit any data to external servers</strong>, unless you choose to export or share files manually.</p>

  <h2>3. How We Use the Information</h2>
  <p>Your data is used solely to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Manage your personal or business cash flow</li>
    <li>Generate local financial reports (e.g., CSV exports)</li>
    <li>Enable core app features (filters, history, etc.)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>The app <strong>does not automatically share</strong> your data with third parties. However, if you use features such as file export or sharing (e.g., `expo-document-picker`, `expo-sharing`), <strong>you are responsible for deciding where your data goes</strong>.</p>

  <h2>5. Device Permissions</h2>
  <p>The app may request the following permissions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Storage</strong>: To save and export CSV files.</li>
    <li><strong>File access</strong>: To import data (in future updates, if available).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These permissions are <strong>not used for advertising or tracking purposes</strong>.</p>

  <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We follow best practices to protect your data. However, since storage is local to your device, <strong>we recommend securing your device with a password</strong> and making regular backups if applicable.</p>

  <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You have full control over your data:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You can edit or delete any information at any time</li>
    <li>You can manually erase all app data (by clearing or uninstalling the app)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Policy Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time. When significant changes occur, we will notify users via the app or through the app store listing.</p>
